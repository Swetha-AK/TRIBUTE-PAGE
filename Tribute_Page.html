            <u>Early Life of Srinivasa Ramanujan</u></h2><br>
            <h4><li>Ramanujan was born in Erode on December 22, 1887,
                 in his grandmother’s house.  Furthermore, he went to
                  primary school in Kumbakonamwas when he 
                  was five years old.</li>
                <li>Moreover, he would attend several different primary 
                    schools before his entry took place to the Town 
                    High School in Kumbakonam in January 1898.</li>
                <li>At the Town High School, Ramanujan proved himself as
                     a talented student and did well in all of his school
                      subjects. In 1900, he became involved with mathematics
                    and began summing geometric and arithmetic series
                     on his own.</li>
                <li>In the Town High School, Ramanujan began reading a
                     mathematics book called ‘Synopsis of Elementary Results
                      in Pure Mathematics’. 
                    Furthermore, this book was by G. S. Carr.</li>
                <li>With the help of this book, Ramanujan began 
                    to teach himself mathematics. Furthermore, the book contained
                     theorems, formulas and short proofs. It also contained
                     an index to papers on pure mathematics.</li>
            </h4><br>
            <h2><u>His Contribution to Mathematics</u></h2><br>
            <h4><li>By 1904, Ramanujan’s focus was on deep research. Moreover, 
                an investigation took place by him of the series (1/n).</li>
                <li>Moreover, calculation took place by him of Euler’s 
                    constant to 15 decimal places.</li>
                <li>This was entirely his own independent discovery.</li>
                <li>Ramanujan gained a scholarship because of his
                 outstanding performance in his studies.</li>
                <li>Consequently, he was a brilliant student at Kumbakonam’s
                     Government College. Moreover, his fascination and passion
                      for mathematics kept on growing.</li>
                <li>In the spring of 1913, there was the presentation of
                     Ramanujan’s work to British mathematicians by 
                    Narayana Iyer, Ramachandra Rao and E. W. Middlemast.</li>
                <li>Afterwards, M.J.M Hill did not made an offer to 
                    take Ramanujan on as a student, rather,
                     he provided professional advice to him. </li>
                <li>With the help of friends, Ramanujan sent letters
                     to leading mathematicians at Cambridge
                     University and was ultimately selected.</li>
                <li>Ramanujan spent a significant time period of five 
                    years at Cambridge. At Cambridge, collaboration took
                     place of Ramanujan with Hardy and Littlewood. Most noteworthy,
                     the publishing of his findings took place there.</li>
                <li>Ramanujan received the honour of a Bachelor of Arts
                     by Research degree in March 1916. This honour was
                      due to his work on highly composite numbers, sections 
                      of the first part whose publishing had taken place the
                       preceding year. Moreover,
                     the paper’s size was more than fifty pages long.</li>
